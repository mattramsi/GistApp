# GistApp

We used ViewCode using UIKit.
Arch selected was MVVM-C, where we opted to inject the coordinator on VM to easier our unit tests and make the view as dummy as possible.

Third Libraries

Pod SDWebImage which has no SPM, this library is used for control cache images.
SPM Snapshot to record snapshot from views.

The snapshots were being recorded on iPhone 15 Pro Max
